New Map File Format:

"SFLvl",
map width as uint16_t
map height as uint16_t
map bgm as string with " at start and end

// in the future, now there would be a list of entities
entity count (which is now 0) as uint16_t
for each entity:
	entity id as uint16_t
	entity x coord as uint16_t
	entity y coord as uint16_t
	entity size-x as uint16_t
	entity size-y as uint16_t
	entity max-health as int16_t
	entity moves-vertical as bool (?)
	entity move-radius as uint16_t

row count as uint16_t

for each row:
	tile count (in the row) as uint16_t

	for each tile:
		tile id (depending on what tile it is) as uint16_t
		tile type (not for tileName = 0) as uint16_t
		tile color (not for tileName = 0) as uint32_t
		tile terrain-type (only for tileName = 2) as int
		tile transition-to-x (only for tileName = 1) as uint16_t
		tile transition-to-y (only for tileName = 1) as uint16_t
		tile transition-to-level-id (only for tileName = 1) as uint16_t
